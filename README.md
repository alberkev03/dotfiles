# Catppuccin-dotfiles
## About
My dotfiles for my Arch Linux system. Feel free to use, modify and share them. I use the "Macchiato" color pallete, mostly because of being a mix between too saturated and too desaturated that feels comfy and easy to watch. Enjoy!

## Features
* Similar key bindings from i3 window manager
* Easy to read and use
* Catppuccin color scheme
* It's very cool
# Important
While almost everything will probably "just works", some things like the screen resolution and the refresh rate may not work. You need to edit the hyprland config file to adjust to your needs.
# How to install
Copy the folders into the .config directory. Hyprland, Rofi, and Neofetch will update instantly or every time you open them, but for other packages you should restart them. I use pkill or killall to stop the package, and then open it again with rofi. 

## Programs used

* [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) - Window Manager

Spotify - Music client. Works great with the music complement in waybar

### Some useful key bindings
Note: I use "Windows" key because it's more easy to abbreviate and I'm used to it.
```
Win + Return - Open the terminal (kitty)
```

```
Win + D - App launcher
```
```
Win + Shift + E - logout menu
```
```
Win + F - Fullscreen
```
## What to do next
I'll try to make a script to automatically install every dotfile and restart the packages, but I don't know how to do that yet. I'm not a programmer, I just like linux, computers and spending (wasting?) time with them. 
## Troubleshooting
If something go bad (probably it will, because it's my first "proyect"), sadly I can't do much. As I said earlier, I don't do programming and every computer is a different world, so I may not be able to fix it. If that happens: Sorry, really!
