# How to install
Copy the folders into the .config directory. Hyprland, Rofi, and Neofetch will update instantly or every time you open them, but for other packages you should restart them. I use pkill or killall to stop the package, and then open it again with rofi. 

## Dependencies

* [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) - Window Manager

* [Hyprpaper](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprpaper) - Wallpaper Manager
* [Waybar-hyprland](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) - Top Bar
* [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) - Terminal
* [ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) - shell with Starship theme
* [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) - Information about my system
* [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) - Packages and power menu
* Awesome/Nerd Fonts/Fira Code - Fonts

## What to do next
I'll try to make a script to automatically install every dotfile and restart the packages, but I don't know how to do that yet. I'm not a programmer, I just like linux, computers and spending (wasting?) time with them.
